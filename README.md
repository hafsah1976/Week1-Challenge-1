# Week 1 - Challenge - 1

## Refactoring Code for a webservice company called Horiseon

My motivation is to learn as much as I can from this course, in general. My aim is to learn new skills and apply them to solve real world problems. This project is built to reach out and help users that are usually owners of businesses (regardless of their business size) to increase their online presence (promote)and be more visible in people's search.

Horiseon provides web services that optimizes the search engine so that when users type certain keywords, their business webpage would show up in the first page of the search, if not in the first few links. Increasing presence on social media platforms significantly and positively (mostly)affects the user's reach to their target audience. That is basically the idea of building this webpage, to build a customer base that is beyond reach.

I have learned quite a few coding etiquettes and tried to implement some, but I could not get the  media queries right, the function for it would have been to resolve the issue of web page that would be viewed in different screen sizes. I am confident that I will figure it out in due time.
